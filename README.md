# talks

**about**

- selected talk outlines by the folks at Convergent
- we usually follow the outlines in this repository, which accompany _amazing_ slide decks vetted by aspiring management consultants, so they may occasionally make less sense when read out-of-context.

**constraints**

- 15-25 min long (because of our meeting structure - subject to change)
- must cater to anyone interested in tech (computer science/eng majors, business/econ majors, etc.) #interdisciplinary 🍻
