# talks
selected talk outlines by the folks at Convergent 😀

i.e., we usually follow these accompanying _amazing_ slide decks vetted by aspiring management consultants 🙃 - may not make sense occasionally

**constraints**

- 15-25 min long (because of our meeting structure - subject to change)
- must cater to anyone interested in tech (computer science/eng majors, business/econ majors, etc.) #interdisciplinary 🍻
